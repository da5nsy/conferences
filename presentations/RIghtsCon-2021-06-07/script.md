# Script for lightning talk at RightsCon2021

8-10 minute recorded talk, in the Human Rights-Centered Design track
(possibly also with an AMA during the conference)

## Original pitch
Data scientists make data-driven decisions throughout the lifecycle of their projects. 
It is their duty to ensure that their work maintains a high level of moral integrity as well as the highest scientific standards, especially, when it impacts peopleâ€™s lives. 
In this presentation, we will introduce The Turing Way, an open source book project that involves and supports its diverse community in developing and sharing resources that make data science reproducible, ethical, collaborative and inclusive. 
In particular, we will demonstrate the Turing Way guide for Ethical Research, the community behind its development, and its human rights-centred approach to data science ethics as a practice that includes activism for change. 
Most importantly, we will demonstrate how RightsCon attendees can get involved!

(Introduce speakers)

The Turing Way is a collaborative book project.
It is based at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national centre for data science and artificial intelligence. 
It's an open source, collaborative project: and has contributors from all over the world.

The aim of the Turing Way is to make reproducible, ethical and inclusive data science 'too easy not to do.'

There are five books in the Turing Way: covering collaboration, project design, reproducibility, communication and outreach, and ethics.
We're going to focus on the Guide to Ethical Research.

The aim of the Guide to Ethical Research is to support data scientists - and researchers using data science - to work in an ethical way.
So far, contributors to the Guide to Ethical Research have contributed chapters on working with institutional ethics boards, the relationship between ethics and research integrity, and ethics in preclinical research.

But we don't see ethics as a static or one-off part of research.
Ethical research includes every part of research: including making sure your institution is treating its workers and its research participants well. 
The Guide to Ethical Research also includes information on how to advocate for policy change within your institution: if you don't like how something is done, you can change it!
It also covers how to be an activist researcher, and how and why unionisation can be important for data scientists to practice ethically.

The Guide to Ethical Research is a work in progress.
Current chapters-in-progress include how ethical data science fits into legal, policy and human rights frameworks; how to address and overcome challenges in ethical practice; and participatory science methods.

We'd like to invite you to become a contributor to the Turing Way, to help us develop these chapters, and many more. 
The best way to contribute is to come along to one of our C
You don't need to have coding experience: just an idea and a willingness to learn.
