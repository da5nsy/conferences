# Script for lightning talk at RightsCon2021

8-10 minute recorded talk, in the Human Rights-Centered Design track - probably about 1500 words
(possibly also with an AMA during the conference)

## Original pitch
([original application](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/conferences/abstracts/2021-01-RightsCon.md))
Data scientists make data-driven decisions throughout the lifecycle of their projects. 
It is their duty to ensure that their work maintains a high level of moral integrity as well as the highest scientific standards, especially, when it impacts people’s lives. 
In this presentation, we will introduce The Turing Way, an open source book project that involves and supports its diverse community in developing and sharing resources that make data science reproducible, ethical, collaborative and inclusive. 
In particular, we will demonstrate the Turing Way guide for Ethical Research, the community behind its development, and its human rights-centred approach to data science ethics as a practice that includes activism for change. 
Most importantly, we will demonstrate how RightsCon attendees can get involved!

(Introduce speakers)
Data scientists make decisions throughout the lifecycle of their data-based projects.
It is their duty to ensure that their work maintains a high level of moral integrity as well as the highest scientific standards, especially when it impacts people’s lives.
The Turing Way is a collaborative book project that aims to make reproducible, ethical, and inclusive data science 'too easy not to do.'
The book is based at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national centre for data science and artificial intelligence. 
It's an open source, collaborative project: and has contributors from all over the world.


There are five books in the Turing Way: covering collaboration, project design, reproducibility, communication and outreach, and ethics.
This talk focuses on the Guide to Ethical Research.

The aim of the Guide to Ethical Research is to support data scientists - and researchers using data science - to work in an ethical way.
We start from the position that as data science researchers, we have an obligation to consider the impact of our research. 
So far, contributors to the Guide to Ethical Research have contributed chapters on working with institutional ethics boards, the relationship between ethics and research integrity, and ethics in preclinical research.

But we don't see ethics as a static or one-off part of research.
Ethical research covers every part of research: including making sure your institution is treating its worker, its research participants, and everyone else involved, well. 
The Guide to Ethical Research also includes information on how to advocate for policy change within your institution: if you don't like how something is done, you can change it!
It also includes information on how to be an activist researcher, and how and why unionisation can be key for an ethical data science practice.

The Guide to Ethical Research is a work in progress.
Current chapters-in-progress include how ethical data science fits into legal, policy and human rights frameworks; how to address and overcome challenges in ethical practice; and participatory science methods.

We'd like to invite you to become a contributor to the Turing Way, to help us develop these chapters, and many more. 
We welcome all kinds of contributions 
Case studies, and lived experiences, are welcome.
You don't need to have coding experience to contribute! 
You just need an idea and a willingness to learn. 
We're a supportive community, governed by a code of conduct, and we have a set of contribution guidelines which keeps our community welcoming and friendly.
We have a monthly newsletter that you can sign up for - and a community Slack workspace, that you can sign up for and introduce yourself to. 
We also run Collaboration Cafes every fortnight to work together on the book.
And twice a year we run Book Dash events, bringing together collaborators from all over the world to work together. 
Or if you'd like to find out more, please come to one of our weekly onboarding calls where you can chat with an experienced community member who will be happy to guide you through the Turing Way
We're looking forward to having you join us!
