## What are you submitting or proposing?
Workshop (longer sessions or training on specific topics) 

### Title of the workshop that you would like to lead
Boost your research reproducibility with Binder

### Abstract for the workshop that you would like to lead (~ 250 words)
Reproducible research is work that can be independently verified. 
In practice, it means sharing the data and code that were used to generate published results with detailed documentation. 
This is often easier said than done as it requires skills and the usage of tools that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers and data scientists.

This workshop will provide an overview of key aspects of reproducibility and skills needed to produce trustworthy and reusable research. 
It will focus on introducing Binder, a tool allowing you to share your software with others in the form of a single clickable link, making it easier for users and removing the need for you to worry about supporting lots of different platforms. 
You will learn how to prepare a binder-ready project on GitHub and have time to take some of your own content (in a R or Jupyter notebook, or scripts that can be run in the terminal) and prepare it with the help of the workshop facilitators so that it can be used by others on myBinder.org.
