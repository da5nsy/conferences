### Title

* The Turing Way: a guide to data science and research

### Authors

* Malvika Sharan  ([*The Alan Turing Institute*](https://www.turing.ac.uk) on behalf of **The Turing Way Collaboration**


### Abstract

The *Turing Way* is an Open Sources community-driven and collaboratively-developed book project on data science and research. 

Launched and demo-ed at the (Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw19) last year, the *Turing Way* aimed at supporting students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible data science is "too easy not to do".
Since its launch, the *Turing Way* has gained interests from a diverse set of community members working across different disciplines within data science research, training, who have made a significant number of [GitHub contributions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) to the project through in-person contribution workshops (book dash events) and online co-working calls (collaboration cafes). Furthermore, the *Turing Way* team members have delivered workshops on GitHub, git, Jupyter Notebook, BinderHub, Binder, and programming workshops to impart skills and confidence to empower new contributors and thus to sustain an open-source ecosystem.

Going forward, *The Turing Way* project aims to expand into a series of books, which, in addition to reproducibility, will capture the vast amounts of knowledge of data science practices in the areas of project design, communication, communication, collaboration, and ethics.  

In this session, we will introduce the *Turing Way* chapters that already exist, the interactive demonstrations that participants can use and re-use for their research, and the directions in which we're continuing to develop. All participants will leave the session knowing that "Every Little Helps" when making their work intentionally designed to be open and reproducible. The session lead and other members of the *Turing Way* community will be available to help and troubleshoot as the participants will start or continue their open research journey while improving The Turing Way for future readers and vice versa.

### Submission Info

This was submitted as a proposal for 1 or 2, 40-minute demonstration session.
