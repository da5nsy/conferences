### Abstract

_(1250 characters max, current count: 865 [please update if you edit])_

A BinderHub (https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a Cloud-based, multi-user server technology that hosts a code repository of Jupyter Notebooks as an interactive browser and generates a unique URL that is easily sharable.
It works by building a Docker image containing the software with all of it's dependencies installed.
This is then hosted in the Cloud and connected to the user's browser.
Building your own BinderHub to host within your own institute/organisation/RSE group is beneficiary as it can be customised to the needs of your specific team.
A privately hosted BinderHub can give the team the choice to host private repos and when these are publicly shared while working reproducibly.
Further customisations can be made, such as: authentication, altering the user-allocated computational resources, persistent storage for users, etc.

### Audience

_Would your target audience be required to have any prerequisite skills/background knowledge e.g. knowledge of a particular language?_

Attendees would preferably be familiar with Microsoft Azure and the command line.

### Outcomes

_How will your attendees benefit from your session? What do you expect them to gain/learn?_

_(600 characters max, current count: 340 [please update if you edit])_

Attendees to this workshop will learn how to deploy a BinderHub on Microsoft Azure Cloud platform.
They will learn the purpose of a BinderHub, how one works and why reproducibility is important in research.
They will gain enough knowledge in the area to make an informed decision on whether building their own BinderHub is a viable option.
