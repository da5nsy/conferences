### Abstract

Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted.
Funders and publishers are beginning to require that publications include access to the underlying data and the analysis code.
The goal is to ensure that all results can be independently verified and built upon in future work.
This is sometimes easier said than done. Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, sofware development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers and data scientists.
The Turing Way is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible data science is "too easy not to do".
It includes training material on version control, analysis testing, and open and transparent communication with future users, and build on Turing Institute case studies and workshops.
This project is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our github repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.
During this session lead developer of the project, Kirstie Whitaker, will lead a collaborative review of the content so far and show CW19 participants how they can contribute their knowledge to make it even better going forwards.
